    Exoplanets, or extrasolar planets, are planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system. In this article, we provide an introduction to exoplanets, including how they are detected and the unique characteristics of these distant worlds.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700">How are Exoplanets Detected?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      There are several methods for detecting exoplanets, including the transit method and the radial velocity method. The transit method looks for a dip in the brightness of a star as an exoplanet passes in front of it, while the radial velocity method measures the slight wobble of a star caused by the gravitational pull of an orbiting exoplanet.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-bold text-gray-700">What Makes Exoplanets Unique?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Exoplanets come in a wide variety of sizes, masses, and orbits, and they can be found in nearly every type of planetary system. Some exoplanets are similar to the planets in our solar system, while others are much larger or smaller and have orbits that are much more eccentric.
